This project in JS used different API's in order to implement functions that could fetch weather, universities, and coordinates in multiple ways. 
It also has some utility functions to edit and read JSON files. The different functions either take in a query (university name) and return information regarding that 
university from the API, or took in coordinates and return information (either weather information or university information) regarding the specific coordinates.
Each function also has a small test file to test to make sure the units are correct, although the code has also been tested by a third party and shown to work when it was created.

I wish to note that the API's that are used in this project may be slow or no longer working.
